# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game consists of multiple Python files:

1. **main.py**: This is the main file that runs the game. It initializes the game environment, creates instances of the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes, and controls the game loop.

2. **snake.py**: This file contains the Snake class, which represents the snake in the game. It includes methods for moving the snake, controlling its direction, detecting collisions with walls and its own tail, and extending the snake's length when it eats food.

3. **food.py**: This file contains the Food class, which represents the food that appears randomly on the screen for the snake to eat. It includes methods for generating random food locations and refreshing the food when eaten by the snake.

4. **scoreboard.py**: This file contains the Scoreboard class, which manages the player's score and displays it on the screen. It includes methods for increasing the score when the snake eats food, resetting the score when the game ends, and updating the scoreboard display.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
- Eat the food (green squares) to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid running into walls or the snake's own tail.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle Module

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
